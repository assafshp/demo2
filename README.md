# Web Calculator

A simple web-based calculator application for performing basic arithmetic operations.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Number input (0-9, decimal point)
- Clear functionality (Clear All, Clear Entry)
- Display area for input and results
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Keyboard support for input and operations
- Error handling for invalid operations (e.g., division by zero, invalid input)

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Development

The project consists of three main files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML structure of the calculator.
- `style.css`: Contains the CSS for styling the calculator.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for calculator functionality.

## Testing

1.  **Manual Testing:**
    *   Open `index.html` in your browser.
    *   Test all number and operation buttons to ensure they function correctly.
    *   Verify decimal point and clear (C, CE) functionalities.
    *   Test chained operations (e.g., 2 + 2 * 3).
    *   Test error cases: division by zero (e.g., 5 / 0), invalid input (e.g., multiple operators without numbers).
    *   Test keyboard support for all numbers, operators, Enter, Escape, Delete, and Backspace keys.
    *   Resize your browser window or use developer tools to test responsiveness on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

2.  **Cross-Browser Compatibility:**
    *   Test the calculator on major web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure consistent behavior and appearance.

## Deployment

This project can be deployed to any static hosting service.

**Example: Deploying to GitHub Pages**

1.  Create a new GitHub repository for your project.
2.  Push your code to the repository.
3.  Go to your repository settings on GitHub.
4.  Navigate to the "Pages" section.
5.  Select the `main` branch (or your preferred branch) as the source for GitHub Pages, and choose the `/ (root)` folder.
6.  Save the settings. Your site will be published at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/`.
