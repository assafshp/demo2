# Overview
This document outlines the product requirements for a simple web-based calculator application. The application aims to provide users with a straightforward and intuitive tool for performing basic arithmetic operations directly within their web browser. It is designed for general users who need quick and accessible calculation functionalities without the need for specialized software.

# Core Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**:
  - What it does: Allows users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  - Why it's important: Forms the fundamental functionality of any calculator.
  - How it works at a high level: Users input numbers and select an operation, and the result is displayed.
- **Number Input**:
  - What it does: Enables users to input numerical values (0-9, decimal point).
  - Why it's important: Essential for performing any calculation.
  - How it works at a high level: Buttons for digits and a decimal point are provided on the UI.
- **Operation Selection**:
  - What it does: Allows users to choose between addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  - Why it's important: Defines the type of calculation to be performed.
  - How it works at a high level: Dedicated buttons for each operation.
- **Clear Functionality**:
  - What it does: Resets the calculator display and state.
  - Why it's important: Allows users to start a new calculation.
  - How it works at a high level: A 'Clear' or 'C' button.
- **Display Area**:
  - What it does: Shows the input numbers, chosen operations, and the calculated results.
  - Why it's important: Provides visual feedback to the user throughout the calculation process.
  - How it works at a high level: A text display area at the top of the calculator interface.

# User Experience
- **User Personas**:
  - **Student**: Needs a quick way to check homework, simple math problems.
  - **Professional**: Uses for quick calculations in reports or spreadsheets.
  - **General User**: Everyday use for budgeting, shopping, etc.
- **Key User Flows**:
  - **Basic Calculation**: User inputs first number -> selects operator -> inputs second number -> presses equals -> result is displayed.
  - **Chained Operations**: User performs a calculation -> result becomes the first number for the next operation.
  - **Error Handling**: Invalid input (e.g., division by zero) displays an error message.
- **UI/UX Considerations**:
  - **Intuitive Layout**: Buttons are clearly labeled and logically grouped.
  - **Responsive Design**: The calculator should be usable and visually appealing on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
  - **Accessibility**: Consideration for keyboard navigation and screen readers.
  - **Visual Feedback**: Buttons should provide visual feedback when pressed.

# Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**:
  - Technology: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, JavaScript for logic. (Can be implemented with vanilla JS or a lightweight framework like React/Vue for future scalability, but vanilla JS is sufficient for MVP).
  - Components: Calculator container, display component, button components (numbers, operators, clear, equals).
- **Backend**:
  - Not required for basic arithmetic operations as all calculations will be performed client-side.
- **Data Models**:
  - Input: Stored as strings to handle multi-digit numbers and decimal points, then converted to numbers for calculation.
  - Operators: Stored as string representations (+, -, *, /).
  - Result: Displayed as a string.
- **APIs and Integrations**:
  - None required for the core functionality.
- **Infrastructure Requirements**:
  - Static hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel) as there is no backend.

# Development Roadmap
- **MVP Requirements**:
  - Basic UI layout with number buttons, operator buttons, clear, and equals.
  - Functionality for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  - Display area showing current input/results.
  - Basic error handling (e.g., division by zero).
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - **Scientific Functions**: Square root, power, trigonometry, etc.
  - **Calculation History**: Display a log of previous calculations.
  - **Keyboard Support**: Allow users to input numbers and operations using their physical keyboard.
  - **Memory Functions**: M+, M-, MR, MC.
  - **Theming**: Light/Dark mode options.

# Logical Dependency Chain
1.  **Project Setup**: Initialize project, basic HTML structure, CSS reset.
2.  **Basic UI Layout**: Implement calculator grid, display, and button containers.
3.  **Number Button Functionality**: Enable input of digits and decimal point to the display.
4.  **Operator Button Functionality**: Capture selected operator.
5.  **Equals Button & Calculation Logic**: Implement core arithmetic functions and handle order of operations.
6.  **Clear Functionality**: Implement reset logic.
7.  **Display Updates**: Ensure display accurately reflects inputs, operations, and results.
8.  **Error Handling**: Implement specific messages for invalid operations (e.g., "Error: DivByZero").
9.  **Basic Styling & Responsiveness**: Make it visually appealing and usable on various devices.

# Risks and Mitigations
- **Floating Point Precision Issues**:
  - Risk: JavaScript's floating-point arithmetic can lead to inaccuracies (e.g., 0.1 + 0.2 â‰  0.3).
  - Mitigation: Use a library for precise decimal arithmetic (e.g., `decimal.js`, `big.js`) or implement custom rounding logic for display. For MVP, simple `toFixed()` might suffice with a warning.
- **Division by Zero**:
  - Risk: Application crash or incorrect output when dividing by zero.
  - Mitigation: Implement explicit check for division by zero and display an "Error" message.
- **User Input Validation**:
  - Risk: Malformed input leading to unexpected behavior.
  - Mitigation: Ensure only valid numbers and operators can be input; sanitize input if necessary.
- **Scope Creep**:
  - Risk: Adding too many features beyond the MVP, delaying launch.
  - Mitigation: Strictly adhere to the MVP requirements for the initial phase; prioritize future enhancements in separate iterations.
- **Browser Compatibility**:
  - Risk: Inconsistent behavior across different web browsers.
  - Mitigation: Test thoroughly on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and use widely supported web standards.
