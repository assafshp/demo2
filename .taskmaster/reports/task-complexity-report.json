			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Project Setup and Basic HTML Structure",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project setup and HTML structure implementation into specific subtasks covering: 1) Project initialization and repository setup, 2) Basic HTML document structure creation, and 3) Calculator component structure implementation with accessibility considerations.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves standard project setup and basic HTML structure creation. The details are well-defined with clear steps and code examples. The complexity is relatively low as it involves fundamental web development practices without complex logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Calculator UI Layout and Styling",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the calculator UI styling task into subtasks focusing on: 1) Basic calculator container and layout styling, 2) Display area and button grid styling with proper visual hierarchy, and 3) Responsive design implementation and accessibility considerations.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires CSS implementation with grid/flexbox layouts and responsive design considerations. While the provided CSS examples offer good guidance, ensuring proper styling across devices and implementing accessibility features adds some complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Number Button Functionality",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the number button functionality implementation into subtasks covering: 1) HTML structure for number buttons, 2) Basic event handling for number input, 3) Decimal point handling with validation, and 4) Display update logic with edge case handling.",
			"reasoning": "This task introduces JavaScript functionality with event handling and state management. It requires handling various edge cases like leading zeros and decimal point validation. The provided code offers a good starting point, but implementation details need careful consideration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Operation Button Functionality",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the operation button functionality into subtasks addressing: 1) HTML structure for operation buttons, 2) Event handling for operation selection, 3) Display update logic for showing selected operations, and 4) Handling operation changes and edge cases.",
			"reasoning": "This task builds on the previous one but adds complexity with operation state management. It requires handling cases where users change operations before entering the second operand and ensuring proper display updates. The logic flow becomes more complex as it interacts with the existing number input functionality."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Equals Button and Calculation Logic",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the equals button and calculation logic implementation into subtasks covering: 1) HTML structure for equals button, 2) Basic arithmetic operations implementation, 3) Error handling for invalid operations, 4) Floating-point precision handling, and 5) Chained operation support.",
			"reasoning": "This task contains the core calculation logic with multiple operations and edge cases. It requires handling floating-point precision issues, division by zero errors, and chained operations. The complexity is higher as it integrates with previous components and needs to handle various mathematical edge cases."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Clear Functionality",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the clear functionality implementation into subtasks addressing: 1) HTML structure for clear buttons, 2) Full clear and clear entry logic implementation, and 3) Visual feedback and state reset verification across different calculator states.",
			"reasoning": "This task is moderately complex as it requires implementing two types of clear functionality (full clear and clear entry) and ensuring they work correctly at different stages of calculation. The implementation itself is straightforward but needs to integrate properly with the existing state management."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Error Handling",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the error handling implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Division by zero error handling, 2) Overflow/underflow detection and handling, 3) Invalid input sequence prevention, and 4) Error state recovery and visual feedback.",
			"reasoning": "This task focuses on comprehensive error handling across various scenarios. It requires detecting and gracefully handling multiple error conditions, providing appropriate user feedback, and ensuring the calculator can recover from error states. The integration with existing calculation logic adds complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Keyboard Support",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the keyboard support implementation into subtasks addressing: 1) Numeric and operation key handling, 2) Special key support (Enter, Escape, Backspace), 3) Visual feedback for keyboard inputs, and 4) Keyboard shortcut documentation and help features.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires implementing keyboard event listeners and mapping various key inputs to calculator functions. While the core logic builds on existing functionality, handling different key combinations, providing visual feedback, and ensuring cross-browser compatibility adds moderate complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 21,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Responsive Design and Cross-Browser Compatibility",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the responsive design and cross-browser compatibility task into subtasks covering: 1) Mobile-first responsive layout implementation, 2) Touch-friendly enhancements for mobile devices, 3) Cross-browser testing and fixes, and 4) Accessibility improvements for different devices and input methods.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves ensuring the calculator works well across different devices, browsers, and screen sizes. It requires implementing responsive design with media queries, handling touch interactions, addressing browser-specific issues, and enhancing accessibility. The testing across multiple environments adds significant complexity."
